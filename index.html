<h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
<p>We are the Web Type Zealots and we have a calling to raise the standards of the web-type world. We

have spawned to illuminate the importance of good typography on the web. We’re not the only ones

who value good type, and it is time for the web world to catch up. We aim to disseminate and celebrate 

information, reasoning, and resources that will empower people in their design endeavors to create a 

better typographic web for all.
</p>
<h2>Our Origins</h2>
<p>The following article is of utmost <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092214/" target="_blank">importance</a> to our history, it marks the moment that the Web Type 

Zealots were conceived. It was this article that sparked a growing conversation around the importance 

of typography in web design. It was this article, coupled with our personal concerns of how typography is 

handled on the web, that made it clear it was time to lead this fight for a better world.

Web Design is 95% Typography

by Oliver Reichenstein

Originally appeared on iA on October 19, 2006

95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should 

get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography.

Back in 1969, Emil Ruder, a famous Swiss typographer, wrote on behalf of his contemporary print 

materials what we could easily say about our contemporary websites:

Today we are inundated with such an immense flood of printed matter that the value of the individual 

work has depreciated, for our harassed contemporaries simply cannot take everything that is printed 

today. It is the typographer’s task to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in 

such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him.

With some imagination (replace print with online) this sounds like the job description of an information 

designer. It is the information designer’s task “to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed 

matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him”.

Macro-typography (overall text-structure) in contrast to micro typography (detailed aspects of type and 

spacing) covers many aspects of what we nowadays call “information design”. So to speak, information 

designers nowadays do the job that typographers did 30 years ago:

Typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information in writing. No argument or

consideration can absolve typography from this duty. A printed work which cannot be read becomes a

product without purpose.

Optimizing typography is optimizing readability, accessibility, usability(!), overall graphic balance. 

Organizing blocks of text and combining them with pictures, isn’t that what graphic designers, usability

specialists, information architects do? So why is it such a neglected topic?

Too few fonts? Resolution too low?

The main—usually whiny—argument against typographical discipline online is that there are only few 

fonts available. The second argument is that the screen resolution is too low, which makes it hard to read 

pixelated or anti-aliased fonts in the first place.

The argument that we do not have enough fonts at our disposition is as good as irrelevant: During the 

Italian renaissance the typographer had one font to work with, and yet this period produced some of the most beautiful typographical work:
